# Web-Applications
While I was in my 6 months internship, I made this simple template of a web app which can be used with little to no code to deploy.
I worked with my front-end team, who helped me learn html, css and js which I could use to integrate it with jinja2 which is a library useful when working with flask. I used sql-alchemy for the database as this is just a template.
